# Challenge Clipboard landing page
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) Clipboard landing page HTML &amp; CSS challenge

# Description:

This challenge required a "Junior" understanding of HTML & CSS. The goal was to recrate a Clipboard landing page using JPG images of the design files for reference.

# What I Learned (as a newbie):
I consider myself a newbie in the area, but I am happy with the result achieved by developing a project whose level of difficulty is for Junior.

I was able to improve a little more my skills in creating responsive pages. By opting for mobile first, it was a little easier to develop the desktop version of the project.

**I learned to use a preprocessor (SaSS)**
Initially, the vast majority of projects I used only Css, which was never a problem because I was always able to solve everything using only Css. However, using Sass was like discovering a new world of possibilities, it made my work more dynamic and fluid.
